# Welcome to my Antarctic-lab. This is a space to upload various versions of my atmospheric river detection algorithm. 
 

#Update 31.05.2023: I've uploaded the latest version of the AR detection algorithm (v2.4). The main difference is that AR detection is extended to 85 N and 85 S. The four scripts are designed around MERRA-2 reanalysis and cover Arctic and Antarctic AR detection using the IWV and vIVT scheme. 

#Update 14.1.2025: I've ported my AR detection algorithm to be compatable with ERA5 data. This is still version 2.4. I've also uploaded the AR catalogs based on ERA5 data from 1980-2023.
