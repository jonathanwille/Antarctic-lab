# Welcome to my Antarctic-lab. This is a space to upload various versions of my atmospheric river detection algorithm 
# along with other bits of code useful for those wanting to study atmospheric rivers over Antarctica. 
# The detection algorithm used in Wille et al. (2019, Nat Geo) is labelled as ar_alg_iwv_v1.py. Hopefully soon, I will
# upload newer versions of the algorithm  with more advanced shape detection schemes and different levels of sensitivity.
