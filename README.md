# Welcome to my Antarctic-lab. This is a space to upload various versions of my atmospheric river detection algorithm. 
 

#Update 31.05.2023: I've uploaded the latest version of the AR detection algorithm. The main difference is that AR detection is extended to 85 N and 85 S. The four scripts are designed around MERRA-2 reanalysis and cover Arctic and Antarctic AR detection using the IWV and vIVT scheme.
