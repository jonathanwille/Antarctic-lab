# Welcome to my Antarctic-lab. This is a space to upload various versions of my atmospheric river detection algorithm 
# along with other bits of code useful for those wanting to study atmospheric rivers over Antarctica. 
# The detection algorithm used in Wille et al. (2019, Nat Geo) is labelled as ar_alg_iwv_v1.py. Hopefully soon, I will
# upload newer versions of the algorithm  with more advanced shape detection schemes and different levels of sensitivity. 

#Update 31.05.2023: I've uploaded the latest version of the AR detection algorithm. The main difference is that AR detection is extended to 85 N and 85 S. The four scripts are designed around MERRA-2 reanalysis and cover Arctic and Antarctic AR detection using the IWV and vIVT scheme.
